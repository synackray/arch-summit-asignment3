# EXAMPLE 1 - Install MQTT
# Here we'll be installing the Eclipse Mosquitto MQTT Broker
# See the in-line comments for explanations on the config.

# This time we've define a Docker Compose version.
version: '3.5'
services:
# We start by defining the service with a name
  mosquitto:
    # Here we reference the image we want to pull from the registry
    image: eclipse-mosquitto
    # We give the container an explicit name instead of auto-generated
    container_name: mosquitto
    # For fun, we're using a different restart policy here.
    # Curious? What's the difference between 'always' and 'unless-stopped'?
    restart: unless-stopped
    # We map the host port tcp/1883 to the container port tcp/1883
    ports:
      - 1883:1883
    volumes:
      # This bind mount is being mapped from the host to the container. Now
      # files in this directory are shared between the host and container.
      - ./mosquitto/config:/mosquitto/config
      # These instead are persistent volumes we've defined in the 'volumes'
      # section below which are mapped to directories within the container
      - mosquitto_data:/mosquitto/data
      - mosquitto_log:/mosquitto/log
